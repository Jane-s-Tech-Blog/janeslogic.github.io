published: true

5G is happening and mobile edge is the most interesting piece in 5G. But there are hypes. Companies jump in and exit with disappointment. Is MEC for real? People are asking. Here are some thoughts:
- Yes, MEC is real, more so with the progressive deployment of 5G
- MEC eventually is a Telco play. They control level of services
- Hyperscalers e.g. AWS, Alibaba, Azure need to work with Telco to get the benefits of MEC
- Telco will see more enterprise customers in MEC
- MEC infrastructure will be mostly from Telco and Hyperscalers. We may not see a neutral edge cloud for some time
